# MonkeyPox
Evaluated 9 machine learning classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, DNN, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) to predict the intensity of monkeypox virus infections.
Feature selection and label encoding were applied to preprocess the dataset before classification. Models were evaluated with and without feature selection.
